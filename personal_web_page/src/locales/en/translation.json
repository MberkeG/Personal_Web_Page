    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "Hello! I'm Melik Berke GÃ¼l. I graduated from Konya Food and Agriculture University, Department of Computer Engineering (100% English), with a GPA of 2.93/4.00. Throughout my education, I gained both academic and practical experience in line with my interest in software development and mobile programming.",
    "p2": "I completed my first summer internship at Kastamonu Provincial Special Administration in a hardware-oriented position. During this period, I had the opportunity to learn about basic hardware structures and public IT infrastructure. My second internship was at TÃœBÄ°TAK SAGE, one of the leading defense industry organizations in our country, in the Software Test Unit. Here, I worked on mobile programming with Java and contributed to the test automation processes of the mobile application I developed. This internship helped me better understand the importance of not only software development but also quality assurance and testing processes.",
    "p3": "In the last year of my undergraduate education, I took part in the project called 'Dijital TarÄ±m' (Digital Agriculture), which was supported within the scope of the TÃœBÄ°TAK 2209-A program and also carried out as a graduation project. In this project, I played an active role in the mobile software development team and contributed to the development of a user-friendly and functional mobile solution for agricultural technologies.",
    "p4": "I strive to improve myself in both frontend and backend development processes. I closely follow modern technologies and care about software architecture as much as user experience.",
    "p5": "As an engineer who is compatible with teamwork, responsible, and able to take the lead when necessary, I aim to produce projects that make a difference with technology."
